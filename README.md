> When I'm with my best friend, I wanna listen to EDM. When I'm alone, I wanna listen to rap. When I'm with my family, I wanna listen to pop.

This application retrieves the "Liked Songs" of a linked Spotify account once every day and then sorts them into predefined playlists with assigned genres.

[![Demo](https://github.com/bemoty/spotify-liked-song-genres/blob/main/.github/action.gif)](https://github.com/bemoty/spotify-liked-song-genres/blob/main/.github/action.mp4)

## Installation

Clone the repository, install the repository and copy the default configuration.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bemoty/spotify-liked-song-genres && cd spotify-lined-song-genres && npm install && cp .config/default.json .config/production.json
```

Then, insert the credentials for your Spotify application created in the [Spotify dev dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

```json
    "client_id": "...",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "redirect_uri": "...",
```

And finally, create genre-specific playlists in your Spotify client, copy the playlist ID from the playlist URL and configure the `"playlists"` section of the config however you want. Quick documentation:

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"id"`        | the ID of the playlist which can be found in the playlist URL (get it with Right click -> Share -> Copy link to playlist)                                                                             |
| `"name"`      | the name of the playlist; doesn't have to be the same as in the client. This field is pretty much only used in the console log right now                                                              |
| `"genres"`    | an array containing all genres which should be put into the playlist                                                                                                                                  |
| `"ngenres"`   | an array containing all genres which should NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES be put in the playlist (helpful if you want a rap playlist but don't want rap of a specific language to be in there)          |
| `"aoverride"` | an array containing artist names which should be put in the playlist. Some artist on Spotify do not have a genre rating yet so you can manually assign artists without a genre rating with this field |

Run the application with `npm run start` (preferrably in a terminal emulator such as [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) or [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html))

P.S.: Documentation for Docker coming soon (or so)

## Commands

I also added some utility commands.

| Command           | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reload`          | runs the main job of the application (refetching liked songs, populating playlists)                                                    |
| `check`           | retrieves all liked songs and checks if there are any artists which can't be put in any playlists because their genres have no mapping |
| `info [artistId]` | retrieves the genres of an artist (takes 1 argument: the artist ID)                                                                    |
| `genres`          | retrieves the genres of all artists and exports them into a CSV file                                                                   |

## By the way...

This was a quick afternoon project I made basically just for use by me. With that being said, I do not take any responsibility for anything this application does, such as your Spotify playlists getting messed up. Please only use this application if you know what you're doing.

Also, everything in here is always subject to change. I might as well just go ahead and rewrite the entire application one day without warning.

If you or anyone you know is actually using this and think it's helpful, I'd love to hear from you and your experience with my project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bemoty). :)
